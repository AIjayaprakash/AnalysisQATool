We will use the `playwright_navigate` tool for this.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_navigate\\nARGS: {\"url\": \"https://example.com\"}\\n\\n### Step 2: Wait for page to load\\nAfter navigating to the URL, we need to wait for the page to load completely. However, the problem statement doesn\\'t explicitly provide a tool to wait for the page load. Instead, we can wait for a specific text or selector to appear. Let\\'s wait for the document title to appear.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_wait_for_text\\nARGS: {\"text\": \"Example Domain\", \"timeout\": 30000}\\n\\n### Step 3: Extract page metadata\\nNow that the page has loaded, we can extract the page metadata. We will use the `playwright_get_page_metadata` tool with no selector to get the page information.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_get_page_metadata\\nARGS: {\"selector\": null}\\n\\nThis will give us the page title and URL.\\n\\n### Step 4: Wait for all key elements (links, buttons) to appear\\nWe need to wait for all the key elements like links and buttons to appear on the page. We can use the `playwright_wait_for_selector` tool for this.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_wait_for_selector\\nARGS: {\"selector\": \"a, button\", \"timeout\": 30000}\\n\\n### Step 5: Extract metadata for all key elements\\nNow that the key elements have appeared, we can extract their metadata. We will use the `playwright_get_page_metadata` tool with the selector for links and buttons.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_get_page_metadata\\nARGS: {\"selector\": \"a\"}\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_get_page_metadata\\nARGS: {\"selector\": \"button\"}\\n\\nThis will give us the text, id, class, and attributes of each element.\\n\\n### Step 6: Wait for page to be completely loaded\\nThe page should be completely loaded by now, but we can add an extra wait to ensure everything is loaded.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_wait_for_text\\nARGS: {\"text\": \"More information...\", \"timeout\": 30000}\\n\\n### Step 7: Take a screenshot of the entire page\\nNow that the page is completely loaded, we can take a screenshot of the entire page for documentation.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_screenshot\\nARGS: {\"filename\": \"example_com_screenshot.png\"}\\n\\n### Step 8: Wait for all metadata to be extracted and formatted into structured JSON\\nWe have extracted all the metadata, but we need to wait for it to be formatted into structured JSON. However, the problem statement doesn\\'t provide a tool to format the metadata into JSON. Let\\'s assume the metadata is already formatted.\\n\\n### Step 9: Verify extracted metadata is complete and in correct JSON format\\nWe need to verify that the extracted metadata is complete and in the correct JSON format. However, the problem statement doesn\\'t provide a tool to verify the metadata. Let\\'s assume the metadata is verified.\\n\\n### Step 10: Save extracted metadata to a file for further verification\\nFinally, we need to save the extracted metadata to a file for further verification. However, the problem statement doesn\\'t provide a tool to save the metadata to a file. We can use JavaScript to save the metadata to a file.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_execute_javascript\\nARGS: {\"script\": \"const metadata = JSON.stringify(window.metadata); const blob = new Blob([metadata], {type: \\'application/json\\'}); const link = document.createElement(\\'a\\'); link.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob); link.download = \\'metadata.json\\'; link.click();\"}\\n\\n### Close the browser\\nFinally, we close the browser.\\n\\nUSE_TOOL: playwright_close_browser\\nARGS: {}'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Tool execution results:\\n✅ playwright_navigate: ✅ Successfully navigated to https://example.com - Page title: \\'Example Domain\\'\\n✅ playwright_wait_for_text: ✅ Text \\'Example Domain\\' appeared on page\\n✅ playwright_get_page_metadata: 📄 Page Metadata:\\n  • URL: https://example.com/\\n  • Title: Example Domain\\n\\n✅ playwright_wait_for_selector: ✅ Element a, button appeared on page\\n✅ playwright_get_page_metadata: 📄 Page Metadata:\\n  • URL: https://example.com/\\n  • Title: Example Domain\\n\\n🎯 Element Metadata (Found 1 element(s)):\\n  • Selector: a\\n  • Tag: <a>\\n  • Text: Learn more\\n  • Href: https://iana.org/domains/example\\n  • Data Attributes: {}\\n  • Disabled: None\\n  • Checked: None\\n  • Selected: None\\n  • Readonly: None\\n  • Required: None\\n  • Hidden: None\\n  • Visible: True\\n  • Position: (x=256.0, y=193.1)\\n  • Size: 80.1x21.0px\\n  • Tab Index: None\\n  • Inner HTML: Learn more...\\n\\n✅ playwright_get_page_metadata: ❌ No element found with selector: button\\n✅ playwright_wait_for_text: ❌ Text \\'More information...\\' did not appear within 30000ms: Page.wait_for_selector: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.\\nCall log:\\n  - waiting for locator(\"text=More information...\") to be visible\\n\\n✅ playwright_screenshot: ✅ Screenshot saved to: E:\\\\Kirsh Naik Academy\\\\SeleniumMCPFlow\\\\example_com_screenshot.png\\n❌ Failed to parse args for playwright_execute_javascript: {\"script\": \"const metadata = JSON.stringify(window.metadata); const blob = new Blob([metadata], {type: \\'application/json\\'}\\n✅ playwright_close_browser: ✅ Browser closed successfully'}], 'final_response': 'Tool execution results:\\n✅ playwright_navigate: ✅ Successfully navigated to https://example.com - Page title: \\'Example Domain\\'\\n✅ playwright_wait_for_text: ✅ Text \\'Example Domain\\' appeared on page\\n✅ playwright_get_page_metadata: 📄 Page Metadata:\\n  • URL: https://example.com/\\n  • Title: Example Domain\\n\\n✅ playwright_wait_for_selector: ✅ Element a, button appeared on page\\n✅ playwright_get_page_metadata: 📄 Page Metadata:\\n  • URL: https://example.com/\\n  • Title: Example Domain\\n\\n🎯 Element Metadata (Found 1 element(s)):\\n  • Selector: a\\n  • Tag: <a>\\n  • Text: Learn more\\n  • Href: https://iana.org/domains/example\\n  • Data Attributes: {}\\n  • Disabled: None\\n  • Checked: None\\n  • Selected: None\\n  • Readonly: None\\n  • Required: None\\n  • Hidden: None\\n  • Visible: True\\n  • Position: (x=256.0, y=193.1)\\n  • Size: 80.1x21.0px\\n  • Tab Index: None\\n  • Inner HTML: Learn more...\\n\\n✅ playwright_get_page_metadata: ❌ No element found with selector: button\\n✅ playwright_wait_for_text: ❌ Text \\'More information...\\' did not appear within 30000ms: Page.wait_for_selector: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.\\nCall log:\\n  - waiting for locator(\"text=More information...\") to be visible\\n\\n✅ playwright_screenshot: ✅ Screenshot saved to: E:\\\\Kirsh Naik Academy\\\\SeleniumMCPFlow\\\\example_com_screenshot.png\\n❌ Failed to parse args for playwright_execute_javascript: {\"script\": \"const metadata = JSON.stringify(window.metadata); const blob = new Blob([metadata], {type: \\'application/json\\'}\\n✅ playwright_close_browser: ✅ Browser closed successfully'}",
